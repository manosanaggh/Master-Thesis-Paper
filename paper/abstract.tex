    Managing big data analytics i.e. Apache Spark poses challenges due to
    limited memory resources in data centers. The memory pressure that
    arises during data processing can result in low server throughput,
    causing delays and inefficiencies. Memory is wasted in long GC
    (Garbage Collection) cycles leaving no room for useful work. In
    this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve server
    throughput for managed big data analytics using smart heap
    offloading to fast storage devices and reducing memory pressure.
    Our approach involves offloading data from heap memory to fast
    storage devices in a smart and efficient manner, thereby freeing
    up heap memory and reducing memory pressure without suffering from
    storage latencies. By overcoming the memory bound we leave space
    to the applications for more CPU utilization. We present a
    detailed methodology for running Apache Spark using our proposed
    mechanism of smart heap offloading, which significantly improves
    server throughput for managed big data analytics. Our proposed
    approach is implemented in Oracle's OpenJDK8 and in this paper we
    evaluate its performance against Native Spark using various
    workloads of the Spark Bench suite on a real-world cluster,
    focusing on examining the performance under the colocation of
    multiple instances. Our experimental results show that our
    approach significantly improves server throughput while reducing
    memory usage against native Spark, making it a promising solution
    for managed big data analytics in data centers. We also include
    results to show that our implementation can reduce money cost if
    deployed in a world cluster like Amazon's EC2 or Google Cloud
    Platform or Microsoft Azure Cloud which are available to everyone.
