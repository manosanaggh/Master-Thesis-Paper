    Managing big data analytics i.e. Apache Spark poses challenges due to
    limited memory resources in data centers.
    %
    \note{jk: What challenges? (memory, cpu?) This is too abstract.
    You should be precise. For example, Managed big data analytic
    frameworks demand more memory to process large amount of data.}
    %
    The memory pressure that arises during data processing can result
    in low server throughput, causing delays and inefficiencies.
    %
    \note{jk: why there is memory pressure?} 
    Memory is wasted in long GC
    (Garbage Collection) \name{jk: first define the full name and then
    the accronym in parenthesis. e.g., garbage collection (GC)} cycles
    leaving no room for useful work. 
    In
    this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve server
    throughput for managed big data analytics using smart heap
    offloading to fast storage devices and reducing memory pressure.
    \note{jk: You do not propose a system or a technique that allows
    you to improve system throughtput. You provide an analysis.}
    %
    Our approach involves offloading data from heap memory to fast
    storage devices in a smart and efficient manner, thereby freeing
    up heap memory and reducing memory pressure without suffering from
    storage latencies.  \note{jk: This is what TeraHeap does.}
    %
    By overcoming the memory bound we leave space
    to the applications for more CPU utilization. 
    %
    We present a
    detailed methodology for running Apache Spark \note{jk: why only
    Spark? Giraph? Other workloads?} using our proposed
    mechanism of smart heap offloading, which significantly improves
    server throughput for managed big data analytics. \note{jk: Why
    your methodology is important. What aspects are you investigate.
    You should write here 2-3 sentences trying to show that you put
    effort for the methodology}. Our proposed
    approach is implemented in Oracle's OpenJDK8 and in this paper we
    evaluate its performance against Native Spark using various
    workloads of the Spark Bench suite on a real-world cluster,
    focusing on examining the performance under the colocation of
    multiple instances. \note{jk: Please write smaller sentences.} 
    Our experimental results show that our
    approach significantly improves server throughput while reducing
    memory usage against native Spark, making it a promising solution
    for managed big data analytics in data centers. We also include
    results to show that our implementation can reduce money cost if
    deployed in a world cluster like Amazon's EC2 or Google Cloud
    Platform or Microsoft Azure Cloud which are available to everyone. 
    \note{jk: Overall comments for the abstract. Abstract should be
    maximum 250 - 300 words. Split it in two or three paragraphs.
    First paragraph state the problem. This paragraph should be
    maximum 3-4 sentences. Next paragraph you should explain what this
    paper provides. In our case is the methodology and evaluation.
    Finally, in the third paragraph you should mention the most
    important results. What the author should rembember.}
